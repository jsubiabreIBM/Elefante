##  Neural Register Architecture

**What are Neural Registers?**  
Immutable "Laws" extracted from debugging sessions - the system's immune memory.

**The 5 Master Registers**:
1. **Installation** - Pre-flight checks, configuration hierarchy, version migration
2. **Database** - Reserved words, single-writer locks, schema validation
3. **Dashboard** - Data path separation, semantic zoom, force-directed physics
4. **MCP Code** - Type signatures, action verification, error enrichment
5. **Memory** - Export bypass, semantic filtering, temporal decay

**Format**: Laws -> Failure Patterns -> Safeguards -> Metrics -> Source Documents

**Purpose**: Prevent recurring failures by encoding lessons as enforceable rules.

## Documentation Statistics

- **Technical Docs**: 10 production documents
- **Neural Registers**: 5 master registers (12+ Laws)
- **Debug Source Docs**: 5 compendium folders
- **Planning Docs**: 3 roadmap documents
- **Archive**: Historical/releases folders
- **MCP Tools**: 14 fully documented

---

## Search Tips

**Looking for specific topics**:
- Installation -> `technical/installation.md` or `debug/installation-neural-register.md`
- API/Tools -> `technical/usage.md` (all 14 tools)
- Architecture -> `technical/architecture.md`
- Dashboard -> `technical/dashboard.md` or `debug/dashboard-neural-register.md`
- Database -> `technical/kuzu-best-practices.md` or `debug/database-neural-register.md`
- Troubleshooting -> `debug/` Neural Registers
- Roadmap -> `planning/roadmap.md`

**File naming convention**: All files use kebab-case (lowercase-with-hyphens)

##  Documentation Etiquette (LLM Instructions)

> **Purpose:** Prevent LLM amnesia and déjà vu errors when maintaining documentation.

### Before Adding Documentation

```
1. READ FIRST, THEN WRITE
   - List the target folder contents
   - Read existing files' headers/structure
   - Search for related content with grep
   
2. NEVER DUPLICATE
   - If topic exists -> AUGMENT the existing file
   - If file is outdated -> UPDATE in place
   - Only create new files for genuinely NEW topics

3. KNOW YOUR FOLDERS
   docs/
   ├── technical/     # HOW things work NOW (production docs)
   ├── debug/         # WHAT WENT WRONG (Neural Registers + sources)
   ├── planning/      # WHAT WE WILL BUILD (roadmaps)
   └── archive/       # HISTORICAL (superseded, outdated)
```

### When to Archive vs Delete vs Update

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Doc is outdated but has historical value | Move to `archive/` with date suffix |
| Doc is superseded by Neural Register | Move to `archive/`, update Register |
| Doc has wrong info | UPDATE in place, don't create new |
| Point-in-time status (e.g., "current-status-2025-11-27") | Archive after issue resolved |
| Protocol evolved (v1 -> v2 -> v3 -> FINAL) | Keep FINAL, archive versions |

### Documentation Update Checklist

```
[ ] 1. Searched for existing docs on this topic
[ ] 2. Read relevant Neural Register (if debug-related)
[ ] 3. Checked archive to avoid resurrecting old content
[ ] 4. Updated ONE file (not created duplicate)
[ ] 5. Updated README index if structure changed
[ ] 6. Verified links still work
```

### Neural Register Update Process

When a significant failure occurs:
1. **Document immediately** in appropriate `debug/{topic}/` file
2. **Extract laws** into the corresponding `*_NEURAL_REGISTER.md`
3. **Link source** in the Neural Register's "Source Documents" section
4. **Archive** point-in-time status docs after resolution

### File Naming Convention

```
# Technical docs: descriptive-name.md
technical/installation.md
technical/kuzu-best-practices.md

# Debug docs: specific-issue-YYYY-MM-DD.md (if date-specific)
debug/dashboard/dashboard-postmortem.md
debug/database/kuzu-reserved-words-issue.md

# Archive: original-name-YYYY-MM-DD.md (preserve origin date)
archive/debug-current-status-2025-11-27.md
archive/protocol-enforcement-v2.md
```

### Anti-Patterns (DON'T DO THIS)

 Creating `new-fix-v2.md` when `fix.md` exists  
 Writing same info in multiple places  
 Leaving point-in-time status docs in active folders  
 Creating doc without checking Neural Register first  
 Archiving without updating indexes
