## Migration Notes

### Upgrading to Unreleased (Dashboard Update)

**Database Migration:**
If you have an existing Kuzu database from before 2024-11-28:
1. The system will automatically detect the old format
2. A backup will be created at `~/.elefante/data/kuzu_db_backup_TIMESTAMP`
3. The database will be re-initialized in the new format
4. Your memories in ChromaDB are preserved (no migration needed)

**Dashboard Access:**
```bash
cd Elefante
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m src.dashboard.server
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in browser
```

**File Relocations:**
If you have custom scripts referencing moved files:
- `add_memories.py` → `scripts/utils/add_memories.py`
- `restart_dashboard.bat` → `scripts/dashboard/restart_dashboard.bat`
- `DASHBOARD_USAGE.md` → `docs/DASHBOARD.md`
