# Schema V2 Archive

**Archived:** 2025-12-11  
**Reason:** v3 is authoritative; v2 docs retained for historical reference

## Contents

| File | Original Location | Purpose |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| `memory-schema-v2.md` | `docs/technical/` | V2 memory schema specification |
| `v2-schema-simple.md` | `docs/technical/` | Simplified v2 schema reference |
| `zlctp-memory-schema-v3-handoff.md` | `docs/planning/` | Migration planning from v2→v3 |

## Context

These documents were superseded by the v3 schema implementation. The current authoritative schema is documented in:
- `docs/technical/architecture.md`
- `src/models/memory.py`

## Why Archived (Not Deleted)

Per **Developer Etiquette LAW 5** (File & Artifact Hygiene):
- Documents represent design decisions and evolution
- May be useful for understanding migration rationale
- Code archaeology value for future maintainers
